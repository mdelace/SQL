--This SQL exercise is from https://mystery.knightlab.com/
It is a SQL Murder Mystery, only information given is the following:
"The crime was a murder that occurred sometime on ​Jan.15, 2018​ and that it took place in ​SQL City​."

--First query I used was SELECT * to understand what I was working with. I always like to do that first.

SELECT *
  FROM crime_scene_report

--Next I filtered city, type and date

SELECT *
  FROM crime_scene_report
  WHERE city = 'SQL City'
  AND type = 'murder'
  AND date = '20180115'

***Results***
|ID     |type   |description                                                      |city    |
|16371  |murder |Security footage shows that there were 2 witnesses. The first    |SQL     |
|       |       |witness lives at the last house on "Northwestern Dr".The second  |        |
|       |       |witness, named Annabel, lives somewhere on "Franklin Ave".       |        |


-- I started off by spliting the two witnesses.
The first witness lives in the last house on ‘Northwestern Dr’. Key word last house, typically 
street numbers are assigned in ascending order. I decided to follow that rule. I filtered street 
name and order by address number in desc. I limited results to 1. 

SELECT *
  FROM person
  WHERE address_street_name = 'Northwestern Dr'
  ORDER BY address_number desc
  LIMIT 1;

***Results***
|id	  |name	          |license_id|address_number	|address_street_name	|ssn      |
|14887|	Morty Schapiro|118009	   |4919	          |Northwestern Dr	    |111564949|


--Given the information from the second witness. I filtered "Annabel" and "Franklin Ave"

SELECT *
  FROM person
  WHERE address_street_name = 'Franklin Ave'
  AND name like 'Annabel%';

***Results***
|id     |	name	          |license_id	|address_number	|address_street_name	|ssn       |
|16371  |	Annabel Miller  |490173	    |103	          |Franklin Ave	        |318771143 |


--Next I filtered both Morty Schapiro and Annabel Miller in the interview table using the id 
number given on person table.

SELECT *
  FROM interview
  WHERE person_id = '14887'
  OR person_id = '16371';

***Results***
|person_id	|transcript                                                                       |
|14887	    |I heard a gunshot and then saw a man run out. He had a "Get Fit Now Gym" bag.The | 
|           |membership number on the bag started with "48Z". Only gold members have those    |
|           |bags. The man got into a car with a plate that included "H42W".                  |
______________________________________________________________________________________________
|16371	    |I saw the murder happen, and I recognized the killer from my gym when I was      |
|           |working out last week on January the 9th.                                        |

--The interview had a lot of important information: Is a male, has a “Get Fit Now Gym” 
membership, membership started with a “48Z”, gold member, plate number included “H42W”. The 
second witness saw the killer on “Jan 9”. Based on the information given I filted id and 
membership_status.

SELECT *
  FROM get_fit_now_member
  WHERE id like '48Z%'
  AND membership_status = 'gold'
  
***Results***
|id	    |person_id	|name	        |membership_start_date	|membership_status|
|48Z7A	|28819	    |Joe Germuska	|20160305	              |gold             |
|48Z55	|67318	    |Jeremy Bowers|20160101	              |gold             |

--The second witness saw him at the gym on January 9. I filtered the results 
given from get_fit_now_member table to the get_fit_now_check_in table. 

SELECT *
  FROM get_fit_now_check_in
  WHERE membership_id = '48Z7A'
  OR membership_id = '48Z55';
  
***Results***
|membership_id	|check_in_date	|check_in_time	|check_out_time |
|48Z7A	        |20180109	      |1600	          |1730           |
|48Z55	        |20180109	      |1530	          |1700           |

--Both members checked in on Jan 09. For the next step I filted the drivers_license table.

SELECT *
  FROM drivers_license
  WHERE plate_number like '%H42W%'
  AND gender = 'male';
  
***Results***
|id	    |age	|height	|eye_color	|hair_color	|gender	|plate_number	|car_make	  |car_model|
|423327	|30	  |70	    |brown	    |brown	    |male	  |0H42W2	      |Chevrolet	|Spark LS |
|664760	|21	  |71	    |black	    |black      |male	  |4H42WR	      |Nissan	    |Altima   |

--Based on the information given. I am going to join tables and filter.

SELECT gm.id AS MembershipID, gm.name, dl.id AS driver_license, dl.plate_number, gm.membership_status
  FROM get_fit_now_member gm
  JOIN person p
  ON gm.person_id = p.id
  JOIN drivers_license dl
  ON p.license_id = dl.id
  WHERE dl.id = '423327'
  OR dl.id = '664760'
  AND dl.plate_number like '%H42W%'
  AND gm.id like '48Z%';
  
***Results***
|MembershipID	|name	        |driver_license	|plate_number	|membership_status|
|48Z55	      |Jeremy Bowers|423327	        |0H42W2	      |gold             |

--Insert into SQL query 
INSERT INTO solution VALUES (1, 'Jeremy Bowers');
  SELECT value FROM solution;
  
***Results***
Congrats, you found the murderer! But wait, there's more... If you think you're up for a challenge, 
try querying the interview transcript of the murderer to find the real villain behind this crime. 
If you feel especially confident in your SQL skills, try to complete this final step with no more than 
2 queries. Use this same INSERT statement with your new suspect to check your answer.


--Second Challange, I filted name to 'Jeremy Bowers'

SELECT i.transcript, p.name
  FROM interview i
  JOIN person p
