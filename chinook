This dataset is called 'chinook'. I am using SQLite

--Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. (Hint: != or <> can be used to say "is not equal to")

SELECT firstname, lastname, customerid, country
  FROM chinook.customers
  WHERE country <> 'USA';
  
--Show only the Customers from Brazil.

SELECT firstname, lastname, country
  FROM chinook.customers
  WHERE country = 'Brazil';
  
--Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, 
and billing country.

SELECT c.firstname||' '|| c.lastname AS fullname, i.invoiceid, i.billingcountry
  FROM chinook.customers c
  JOIN chinook.invoices i
  ON c.customerid = i.customerid
  WHERE c.country = 'Brazil';

--Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.
SELECT *
  FROM chinook.employees
  WHERE title LIKE 'Sales%'
  AND title LIKE '%Agent';
